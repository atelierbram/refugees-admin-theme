### Typography
This theme depends on the webfont [Fira Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Sans) being available. The medium 500 weight is used for bold, and the light 300 weight is used for the light-on-dark text in the interface. The fonts are enqueued in the plugin, and pulled in from Google Webfonts.
